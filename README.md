# BullCowGame
## The classic word game

The game was created as a part of a Udemy Course,

[The Unreal Engine Developer Course - Learn C++ & Make Games ](https://www.udemy.com/unrealcourse/) by @BenTristem @GameDev.tv

I added some additional functions as to make the game more intresting.

## Additional Functions
- The player starts with 3 hints and gets 1 hint for every successfull guess
-  The Score is calculated by the number of tries it took to guess the word
- Optional to continue playing 
- Reading from a file and loading the words to the memory
- The Game always start with a random word

**If you wish to add your own words to the game just add them to the _WordDictionary.txt_**

**_Only Isogram Words_**

Hope you Enjoy.
